# wedding

This is the bilingual front-end portion of the website I built for my wedding to keep track of wedding RSVP's on the back end. This is to allow guests, to submit and update their own wedding rsvp's with a code provided by the wedding party. Built with Vue JS, Bulma, and a little love.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
